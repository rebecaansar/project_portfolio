Below are my answers to Udemy's "Complete SQL Bootcamp" Skills Assessment.

SELECT * FROM cd.facilities;

You want to print out a list of all of the facilities and their cost to members.
How would you retrieve a list of only facility names and costs?

SELECT name, membercost FROM cd.facilities;

and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost?
Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.

SELECT facid, name AS facility_name, membercost, monthlymaintenance
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE membercost >0 AND (membercost < monthlymaintenance/50.0);

How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?

SELECT *
FROM cd. facilities
WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';

How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR operator.

How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012?
Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.

SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';

How can you produce an ordered list of the first 10 surnames in the members table?
The list must not contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT surname FROM cd.members
WHERE surname != 'GUEST'
ORDER BY surname
LIMIT 10;

You'd like to get the signup date of your last member. How can you retrieve this information?

SELECT MAX(DATE(joindate)) FROM cd.members

Produce a count of the number of facilities that have a cost to guests of 10 or more.

SELECT COUNT(name) FROM cd.facilities
WHERE guestcost >= 10;

Produce a list of the total number of slots booked per facility in the month of September 2012.
Produce an output table consisting of facility id and slots, sorted by the number of slots.

SELECT facid AS facility_id, SUM(slots) AS slots
FROM cd.bookings
GROUP BY facid
ORDER BY slots;

Produce a list of facilities with more than 1000 slots booked.
Produce an output table consisting of facility id and total slots, sorted by facility id.

SELECT facid AS "Facility ID", SUM(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM cd.bookings
GROUP BY facid
HAVING SUM(slots) > 1000
ORDER BY facid;

How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-21'?
Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.

SELECT starttime AS "Start Time", name AS "Facility Name"
FROM cd.bookings
INNER JOIN cd.facilities ON cd.facilities.facid = cd.bookings.facid
WHERE DATE(starttime) = '2012-09-21' AND name LIKE 'Tennis Court%'
ORDER BY starttime;
