# Case Studies

**Case Study:** Sunsetting Tableau and Enhancing Analytics Infrastructure

**Problem:** Our company faced significant analytics tech debt on Tableau, including outdated data connections, unreliable dashboards, and slow-loading reports critical for executive updates, making them prohibitive to use effectively.

**Role:** Led the end-to-end initiative to decommission Tableau and migrate core dashboards to modern and efficient analytics tooling.

**Action:** Designed a 12-month project plan to sunset Tableau and collaborated with stakeholders across operations, sales, marketing, finance, and executive leadership.
Re-created critical dashboards with stakeholders using existing tools (Metabase) and a new dashboarding solution (Hex).
Worked with Tableau representatives to reduce the account plan to a minimum, saving thousands during the transition.
Prioritized and streamlined dashboard migration, ensuring reliable and fast-loading analytics reports for decision-making.

**Result:** Improved dashboard reliability and performance, reducing load times and enhancing usability for executives and teams.
Delivered $12,000 in annual cost savings by eliminating unnecessary Tableau subscriptions.
Enabled faster and more informed decision-making through modernized analytics infrastructure.

**Case Study:** Promoting and Scaling Diversity in Hiring for Analytics Roles

**Objective:** To recruit the first Senior Data Analyst for the team while improving gender diversity, particularly increasing the representation of women within the engineering team. Additionally, to scale this method across other hiring processes in the organization.

**Approach:**
Identified the underrepresentation of women within the engineering team and collaborated with a third-party technical recruiting vendor to emphasize the need for diversity.
Explored diverse recruitment avenues, including women-in-tech networks and industry events, to ensure women candidates were represented in the pipeline.
Engaged leadership to scale this approach across other teams. When another team was hiring for a data analyst role, participated in the interview panel to ensure accountability from the recruiting team in maintaining a diverse candidate pool.
Monitored and provided feedback to the recruiting team, resulting in a more evenly distributed ratio of women to male candidates for the analytics role compared to historical data.

**Outcome**
Successfully expanded the candidate funnel, achieving a more balanced representation of women candidates for the Senior Data Analyst position.
Scaled the diversity-focused hiring strategy across teams, leading to a significantly improved gender ratio for additional analytics roles, demonstrating the organization's commitment to building a more inclusive workforce.

**Case Study:** Predictive Model for Seamless Driver Payment Authorization

**Problem:** Drivers frequently encountered insufficient payment authorizations, leading to additional charges, a disjointed repayment experience, and financial risk for the company.

**Role:** Developed and deployed an XGBoost regressor model to predict transaction amounts, conducted extensive feature engineering, and ensured seamless integration and customer transition in collaboration with key stakeholders and the engineering team.

**Action:**
* Conducted extensive feature engineering to identify the strongest predictors of driver purchasing behavior, optimizing the model’s accuracy.
* Built and fine-tuned an XGBoost regressor model to predict transaction amounts with high precision.
* Partnered with the engineering team to integrate the model into the payment authorization pipeline, ensuring preauthorization of cards for slightly above predicted amounts.
* Designed a comprehensive dashboard to monitor the model’s performance and provide actionable insights, supporting the model’s continued success in production for over a year.
* Collaborated with customer support to ensure a seamless transition for drivers, with minimal disruption to the customer experience.

**Result:**
* Improved median payment authorization accuracy to within + $50 of actual transaction amounts, a significant shift from a median of -$70, reducing the need for differential charges for the majority of drivers.
* Increased the sufficiency rate by 130%, ensuring transaction amounts were fully covered far more often.
* Delivered a stable, scalable solution with positive feedback from drivers and consistent customer support metrics.
* Achieved long-term operational efficiency through a reliable, high-performing model and dashboard-driven oversight.

**Case Study:** Developing a Customer Retention and Churn Model Using the "Buy ‘Til You Die" Approach

**Objective:** To create the company’s first customer retention and churn model, enabling the marketing team to proactively target at-risk customers with personalized campaigns aimed at improving retention.

**Approach:**
Utilized the "Buy ‘Til You Die" model, which leverages recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) value variables to assess the likelihood of customers becoming repeat purchasers. This sophisticated approach was foundational to building a churn model that could reliably predict customer attrition.
Collaborated with the marketing team to ensure the model’s outputs aligned with their campaign strategies, focusing on actionable insights that identified customers at risk of lapsing.
Designed a real-time dashboard for monitoring churn risk scores, allowing the marketing team to access insights instantly and engage at-risk customers effectively.

**Outcome:**
Successfully implemented the company’s first driver churn/retention model, empowering the marketing team to target at-risk customers in campaigns based on data-driven predictions.
The model is anticipated to lead to improved customer retention rates, enhancing the effectiveness of marketing outreach and establishing a new standard for customer engagement strategies.
