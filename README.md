#Case Studies

**Case Study:** Promoting and Scaling Diversity in Hiring for Data Analyst Roles

**Objective:** To recruit the first Senior Data Analyst for the team while improving gender diversity, particularly increasing the representation of women within the engineering team. Additionally, to scale this method across other hiring processes in the organization.

**Approach:**
Identified the underrepresentation of women within the engineering team and collaborated with a third-party technical recruiting vendor to emphasize the need for diversity.
Explored diverse recruitment avenues, including women-in-tech networks and industry events, to ensure women candidates were represented in the pipeline.
Engaged leadership to scale this approach across other teams. When another team was hiring for a data analyst role, participated in the interview panel to ensure accountability from the recruiting team in maintaining a diverse candidate pool.
Monitored and provided feedback to the recruiting team, resulting in a more evenly distributed ratio of women to male candidates for the analytics role compared to historical data.
Outcome:

Successfully expanded the candidate funnel, achieving a balanced representation of women candidates for the Senior Data Analyst position.
Scaled the diversity-focused hiring strategy across teams, leading to a significantly improved gender ratio for additional analytics roles, demonstrating the organization's commitment to building a more inclusive workforce.
