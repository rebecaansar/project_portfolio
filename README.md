# Case Studies

**Case Study:** Promoting and Scaling Diversity in Hiring for Analytics Roles

**Objective:** To recruit the first Senior Data Analyst for the team while improving gender diversity, particularly increasing the representation of women within the engineering team. Additionally, to scale this method across other hiring processes in the organization.

**Approach:**
Identified the underrepresentation of women within the engineering team and collaborated with a third-party technical recruiting vendor to emphasize the need for diversity.
Explored diverse recruitment avenues, including women-in-tech networks and industry events, to ensure women candidates were represented in the pipeline.
Engaged leadership to scale this approach across other teams. When another team was hiring for a data analyst role, participated in the interview panel to ensure accountability from the recruiting team in maintaining a diverse candidate pool.
Monitored and provided feedback to the recruiting team, resulting in a more evenly distributed ratio of women to male candidates for the analytics role compared to historical data.

**Outcome**
Successfully expanded the candidate funnel, achieving a more balanced representation of women candidates for the Senior Data Analyst position.
Scaled the diversity-focused hiring strategy across teams, leading to a significantly improved gender ratio for additional analytics roles, demonstrating the organization's commitment to building a more inclusive workforce.

**Case Study:** Developing a Customer Retention and Churn Model Using the "Buy ‘Til You Die" Approach

**Objective:** To create the company’s first customer retention and churn model, enabling the marketing team to proactively target at-risk customers with personalized campaigns aimed at improving retention.

**Approach:**
Utilized the "Buy ‘Til You Die" model, which leverages recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) value variables to assess the likelihood of customers becoming repeat purchasers. This sophisticated approach was foundational to building a churn model that could reliably predict customer attrition.
Collaborated with the marketing team to ensure the model’s outputs aligned with their campaign strategies, focusing on actionable insights that identified customers at risk of lapsing.
Designed a real-time dashboard for monitoring churn risk scores, allowing the marketing team to access insights instantly and engage at-risk customers effectively.

**Outcome:**
Successfully implemented the company’s first driver churn/retention model, empowering the marketing team to target at-risk customers in campaigns based on data-driven predictions.
The model is anticipated to lead to improved customer retention rates, enhancing the effectiveness of marketing outreach and establishing a new standard for customer engagement strategies.
